Whawhai recruitment test.

I choose to implement Home screen for 2 reasons, one is because it is most naturall to me to start with the Home page,
second is that at first glance it seemed to have the most events to implement.
Website is deployed on heroku and you can find it on following link: https://whawhai.herokuapp.com/.
Alternatively you can download the files and lunch it with npm start.
